## TuxKartAI 

This is an attempt to make a self driving ai that plays SuperTuxKart. This project demos how we can train a CNN to do complicated tasks such as navigating traffic by converting it into a classification problem. The model has 3 classes:- forward, left and right. We collect data for training the CNN by recording screenshots and keypresses while playing the game. We trained the data on Alexnet CNN model.
